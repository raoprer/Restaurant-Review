# Bag-of-Words Model for Restaurant Review Classification
This repository contains code for building a Bag-of-Words (BoW) model to classify restaurant reviews. The BoW model is a commonly used technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that represents text data as a collection of unique words and their frequencies.

## About
The ability to automatically classify restaurant reviews can provide valuable insights for businesses and consumers alike. In this repository, we employ a Bag-of-Words model to analyze the text of restaurant reviews and predict whether they convey a positive or negative sentiment.

The BoW model breaks down each review into individual words, discarding grammar and word order, and considers the frequency of each word as a feature for classification. By training a classifier on labeled data, the model learns to recognize patterns and make predictions on new, unseen reviews.
